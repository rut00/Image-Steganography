# Image Steganography

 This application is used for hiding text messages to Image file using a technique called Least Significant Bit. 
 
<h4> Implementation: </h4>
Both cover file and secret message are fed into steganographic encoder as input. Steganographic Encoder function, embeds the secret message into a cover file. Resulting Stego Object looks very similar to the cover file, with no visible changes. This completes encoding. To retrieve the secret message, Stego Object is fed into Steganographic Decoder.

<h4> Output: </h4>
Image before hiding secret message:
